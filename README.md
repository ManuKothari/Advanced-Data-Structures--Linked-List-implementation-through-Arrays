Advanced-Data-Structures--Linked-List-implementation-through-Arrays
===================================================================

This is implementation of a Linked List using Arrays. We use the concept of linked list , but through Arrays. Using Arrays saves the overheads of dynamic allocation of memory and helps through index traversal rather than linear in linked list. Using which I could get brilliant results: I inserted a random 50000 elements in the programs and got these results:  Average time taken by List implemented using Arrays ( in seconds ) : 3.254829489  Average time taken by List ( without header node ) ( in seconds) : 6.663692383 Average time taken by List ( with header node ) ( in seconds ) : 6.558834766
